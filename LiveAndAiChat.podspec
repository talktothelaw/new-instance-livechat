    LiveAndAiChat is a complete iOS chat SDK for newinstance.cloud. It ships a
    SwiftUI chat screen, typing indicators, image and file attachments, an
    in-app image viewer, a two-tier image cache, and a transport stack
    resilient to flaky networks (HTTP/1.1-pinned Server-Sent Events with
    WebSocket fallback, silent gap-fill resync, exponential reconnect).
    Branding and behaviour are configured from the newinstance.cloud dashboard
    — your app just supplies an API key and a user identity.
